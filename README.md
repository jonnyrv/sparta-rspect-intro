# Unit Testing (RSpect)

We have learned about unit testing, how to use RSpec in Ruby and about the importance of RSpec documentation.

## Objectives
How to write simple tests.

# Homework
Create 3 test cases that should test the multiply, divide, substract methods of the calculator. 

# How to run the test cases
First you have to open the sparta_rspec_intro folder in your terminal. After that you need to open the rspec_calculator folder.
On the terminal inside the rspec_calculator folder you need to run the command : "rspec". This command will run all the tests created for the cal_engine.
If the tests are succesfull in the terminal it should appear 4 examples, 0 failures. If not inside the terminal it should say 4 examples, 1-4 faliures and under it should be specified which tests failed.
