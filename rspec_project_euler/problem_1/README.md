#Problem One Tests 

In the first problem we were supposed to test if the numbers were divisible by 3 and 5 and if it correctly adds the number together if they are. 

##How to run the tests 

In your terminal you open the folder sparta-rspect-intro from there you go to the folder rspec_project_euler and from there to problem_1. 

sparta-rspect-intro ----> rspec_project_euler ----> problem_1.

Now when you are inside the folder problem_1, in your terminal run the command : "rspec". Now it should show if you tests failed or passed.

#Problem Two Tests

In the second problem we were supposed to test if fibonacci sequence does not exceed 4 million we should find the even numbers and add them together.

##How to run the tests

In your terminal you open the folder sparta-rspect-intro from there you go to the folder rspec_project_euler and from there to problem_1. The files for the second problem are located in the same folder as the first one. 

sparta-rspect-intro ----> rspec_project_euler ----> problem_1.

Now when you are inside the folder problem_1, in your terminal run the command : "rspec". Now it should show if you tests failed or passed.
This will show the tests for both of your problems.
